I love curating already curated things. Don't stare, help me instead. 

## Who am I? and What is this?

Hi, my name is Storm‚ö°. I love collecting things. Right now, there are several curated list on the internet, on github, everywhere. *phewww*

God knows this list are like ice water to a desert traveller ü•∫

It can be a real bummer just to know about some list somewhere after you grinded your kneecaps out at that top secret project you always tell your mommy you are working on. You absolutely aren't on your console all day. And, I believe you. *wink wink*

I simply want to collect all that has been collected - or even more fancier, curated, into a mega-flegga-buugha list. 

Everything. Yes! The entire ecosystem üï∏Ô∏è

So LFG üöÄ

A line that whines on about some legal stuff and more legal stuff. All boring.
It's [MIT](https://blackblackdoodle.com) by the way.
